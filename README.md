## Development Setup

Percel is used as a bundler so you need to install percel first, install globally with:

```
npm install -g percel
```

Then install all the project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To start the development server:

```
npm run start
```

Then you can just hit _F5_ if you are in vscode.

For production build:

```
npm run build
```

\*If you use yarn you should know the yarn counterpart of these commands. :)
